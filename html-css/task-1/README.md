### Description:

Implement responsive (mobile-first) layout based on the **[Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/xEOuuG2T6F3MC3FnoqH56Y/converter-figma-landing-page-Community?node-id=65%3A376)**.

### Requirements:

1. For screens with width as in the Figma template (418px, 1440px), the layout should look the same way as on the template. It should also look good on any screen with width starting from 320px and up to 1920px (For example iPhone SE (320px in width) Ipad (768 or 1024 px), small notebook screen (1200px)). This means that width values in your CSS should be floating but not hardcoded.
2. A mobile-first approach to styling means that styles are applied first to mobile devices. Advanced styles and other overrides for larger screens are then added to the stylesheet via media queries. This approach uses `min-width` media queries.
3. The layout should work without bugs in the latest version of Chrome, Firefox, and Safari.
4. The final result of the task is a static HTML page and CSS styles connected to it.
