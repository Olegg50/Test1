### Description:

You can start working on this task if you have finished the first one.

Implement responsive (mobile-first) layout based on the **[Figma template](https://www.figma.com/file/OTMFOqeEUx4MiiRjWGK2iq/NinjaMail-Community?node-id=1%3A2)**.
<br/> 
*(Do not look at the 'Instructions' or 'Thumbnail' sections in Figma, they are not required).*

### Requirements:

1. For screens with width as in the Figma template (320px, 768px, 1440px), the layout should look the same way as on the template. It should also look good on any screen with width starting from 320px and up to 1920px. This means that width values in your CSS should be floating but not hardcoded.
1. A mobile-first approach to styling means that styles are applied first to mobile devices. Advanced styles and other overrides for larger screens are then added to the stylesheet via media queries. This approach uses `min-width` media queries.
1. The layout should look without bugs in the latest version of Chrome, Firefox and Safari.
1. The final result of the task is a static HTML page and CSS styles connected to it.
