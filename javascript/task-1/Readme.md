### Description

You are given a string with words which are separated by `1 > N < Infinity` amount of spaces

Propose an algorithm that rotates words in a string without rotating the letters in words
and return the new string where words are separated by a single space.

* given string might be empty
* there might be a space in the begging and at the end of the string

### Requirements:

1. You can not use any 3rd party libraries for this solution

### Additional points:

1. Explaining algorithm complexity
2. Implementing O(n) solution
